# WFNightwatchNapalmSim
Ported to GitHub. Created July 10th 2021.

NOTE: This was exploratory simulation and analysis, and is not fully presentable.

Simulates the effectiveness of Faction mods in Warframe specifically for Kuva Ogris with the Nightwatch Napalm mod.

The DPS increase from equipping a 1.9 times faction multiplier was simulated to a result of 3.172x.
